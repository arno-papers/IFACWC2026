  abstract = {We introduce a gravitational waveform inversion strategy that discovers mechanical models of binary black hole (BBH) systems. We show that only a single time series of (possibly noisy) waveform data is necessary to construct the equations of motion for a BBH system. Starting with a class of universal differential equations parameterized by feed-forward neural networks, our strategy involves the construction of a space of plausible mechanical models and a physics-informed constrained optimization within that space to minimize the waveform error. We apply our method to various BBH systems including extreme and comparable mass ratio systems in eccentric and noneccentric orbits. We show that the resulting differential equations apply to time durations longer than the training interval, and relativistic effects, such as perihelion precession, radiation reaction, and orbital plunge, are automatically accounted for. The methods outlined here provide a data-driven approach to studying the dynamics of binary black hole systems.}

  abstract = {Highly-interconnected societies difficult to model the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Single-region SIR models fail to account for incoming forces of infection and expanding them to a large number of interacting regions involves many assumptions that do not hold in the real world. We propose using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to capture the influence of neighboring regions and improve the model's predictions in a combined SIR+UDE model. UDEs are differential equations totally or partially defined by a deep neural network (DNN). We include an additive term to the SIR equations composed by a DNN that learns the incoming force of infection from the other regions. The learning is performed using automatic differentiation and gradient descent to approach the change in the target system caused by the state of the neighboring regions. We compared the proposed model using a simulated COVID-19 outbreak against a single-region SIR and a fully data-driven model composed only of a DNN. The proposed UDE+SIR model generates predictions that capture the outbreak dynamic more accurately, but a decay in performance is observed at the last stages of the outbreak. The single-area SIR and the fully data-driven approach do not capture the proper dynamics accurately. Once the predictions were obtained, we employed the SINDy algorithm to substitute the DNN with a regression, removing the black box element of the model with no considerable increase in the error levels.},

  abstract = {PySR is an open-source library for practical symbolic regression, a type of machine learning which aims to discover human-interpretable symbolic models. PySR was developed to democratize and popularize symbolic regression for the sciences, and is built on a high-performance distributed back-end, a flexible search algorithm, and interfaces with several deep learning packages. PySR's internal search algorithm is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm, which consists of a unique evolve-simplify-optimize loop, designed for optimization of unknown scalar constants in newly-discovered empirical expressions. PySR's backend is the extremely optimized Julia library SymbolicRegression.jl, which can be used directly from Julia. It is capable of fusing user-defined operators into SIMD kernels at runtime, performing automatic differentiation, and distributing populations of expressions to thousands of cores across a cluster. In describing this software, we also introduce a new benchmark, "EmpiricalBench," to quantify the applicability of symbolic regression algorithms in science. This benchmark measures recovery of historical empirical equations from original and synthetic datasets.},
